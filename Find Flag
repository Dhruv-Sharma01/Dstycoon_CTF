How did I do this?

I firstly asked CHATGPT to decode the messsage given in question.
Then I converted the given hexdaecimal encoded message into base 64 encoding and then I converted obtained string into ASCII text using online converters.
I wrapped the obtained string into CTF{} and submitted. Answer was correct.
